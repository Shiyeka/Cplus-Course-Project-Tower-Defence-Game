A Tower Defence Game made by our 3-person team using C++ as the course project in Introductory Programming II, where I obtained 97/100 grade, finally presented in the class at 19th June, 2019.

The game project has entering pages, play instructions and game stages with different difficulty levels. Running around the map, the player can build and upgrade three kinds of towers with different attacking ways: shooting, casting magics and bombing. We created attacking visual effects using built-in functions provided by the Qt IDE platform. The enemies will appear at pre-set intervals. Background music, random collectable coins and an ultimate skill system are also added.

This project demonstrates my learning to C++ language. Although I did not write projects using C++again after the course ended, it help me lay foundations to understand other programming languages such as Python.
